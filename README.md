<h1>Digital Store Full-Stack Development Project</h1>
<p>This is a full-stack development project for a digital store, built using React.js for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and MySQL for the database.</p>
<h3>Skills Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>
React.js
</li>
<li>
Node.js
</li>
<li>
Express
</li>
<li>
MySQL database
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The digital store is a fully functional e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. The project is divided into two main parts - the front-end and the back-end.</p>

<h4>Front-End</h4>
<p>The front-end is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website has a clean and modern design with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The website allows users to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Browse products by category or search for specific items</p></li>
<li><p>View product details and images</p></li>
<li><p>Add products to a cart</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the quantity of products in the cart</p></li>
<li><p>Remove products from the cart</p></li>
<li><p>Checkout and make payment using a third-party payment gateway</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Back-End</h4>
<p>The back-end is built using Node.js and Express, a popular framework for building web applications. The back-end provides an API for the front-end to interact with the database. The back-end is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Retrieving products from the database and returning them to the front-end</p></li>
<li><p>Handling requests to add, edit, or remove products from the cart</p></li>
<li><p>Generating and returning an order ID to the front-end for payment processing</p></li>
<li><p>Handling payment processing and order confirmation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The back-end uses a MySQL database to store product and user information. The database schema includes tables for products, users, carts, and orders.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>During the development of this project, I learned a lot about full-stack development using React.js, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Some of the key things I learned include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Building a responsive front-end using React.js and CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express</p></li>
<li><p>Writing SQL queries to interact with a database using MySQ</p></li>
</ul>
