<h1>iDigital Store Full-Stack Development Project</h1>
<p>This is a fullstack development project that Lior Grishin and I built to create a fully functional idigital store. The project uses React.js, Redux Toolkit Node.js and Express, and a MySQL database. The project allows users to browse digital products, add them to their cart, and checkout using Stripe.</p>
<h3>Skills Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>
React.js
</li>
<li>
Node.js
</li>
<li>
Express
</li>
<li>
MySQL database
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The idigital store is a fully functional e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. The project is divided into two main parts - the front-end and the back-end.</p>

<h4>Front-End</h4>
<p>The front-end is built using React.js. The website has a clean and modern design with a responsive layout that adapts to different computer screen sizes. mobile responsiveness is on its way. The website allows users to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Browse products by category or search for specific items</p></li>
<li><p>View product details and images</p></li>
<li><p>Add products to a cart</p></li>
<li><p>Remove products from the cart</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Running the front-end is avilable by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>downloading or forking the code.</li>
        <li>opening a terminal on the client folder</li>
        <li>Writing npm i in the command line</li>
        <li>After instalation is over, writing npm start</li>
    </ul>
 
<h4>Back-End</h4>
<p>The back-end is built using Node.js and Express. The back-end provides an API for the front-end to interact with the database. The back-end is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Retrieving products from the database and returning them to the front-end</p></li>
<li><p>Handling requests to add, edit, or remove products from the cart</p></li>
<li><p>Generating and returning an order ID to the front-end for payment processing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The back-end uses a MySQL database to store product and user information. The database schema includes tables for products and users.</p>
<p>This project does not include check out on purpos, to prevent confusion since it looks like the real site.</p>
    
    <p>Running the back end is not possible at the moment to prevent confusion. The code is still available to read.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>During the development of this project, I learned a lot about full-stack development using React.js, Redux Toolkit Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Some of the key things I learned include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Building a responsive front-end using React.js and CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express</p></li>
<li><p>Writing SQL queries to interact with a database using MySQ</p></li>
</ul>    

<h3>Summery</h3>
<p>Building this project helped me develop my skills in fullstack development, specifically with React.js and Node.js. I also gained experience working with a MySQL database and integrating a payment system (Stripe) into a web application.

Working on this project also taught me the importance of planning and organizing code for scalability and maintenance. As the project grew in complexity, I had to refactor code and optimize database queries to improve performance.

Overall, this project allowed me to learn and practice a wide range of skills that are essential for building fullstack web applications.</p>
